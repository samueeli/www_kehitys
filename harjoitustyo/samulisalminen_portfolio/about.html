          <p>
            I was born in 1984 in Finland. I spent my childhood running around forests playing hide and seek with my
            friends, jumping from rock to rock and climbing trees. I wasn’t particularly interested about technology. In
            fact, we didn’t even have a computer at home. Back then, that was the case with most households.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first computer course I remember was in secondary school when I was around thirteen. At that time those
            clumsy Microsoft Paint, Word and Netscape weren’t enough to sweep me off my feet. I was more into music and
            creative arts. My mom put me into music play school when I was 4 years old and later on that led me to my
            first profession.
          </p>
          <p>
            My parents were open to different cultures. When an opportunity opened for me to go to Los Angeles to study
            music, the idea felt quite natural and exciting. In the USA I met my future wife Marianne, an exchange
            student from Switzerland. After finishing my studies at Los Angeles Music Academy in 2007, I moved to
            Switzerland and we got married. I got an internship at a local church where I was responsible for organising
            the music. Spirituality started to interest me. In the Fall of 2009, I began my pastoral studies at Suomen
            teologinen opisto.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ok, now that you know a little bit about my history let me finally tell you how I came around IT and became
            a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seven years, two degrees and 3 children later, we were living in Tampere Finland. Things weren’t easy. My
            wife was on maternity leave and I was unemployed. I had to do something. And as uncreative and unintuitive
            it felt, I decided to make a rational decision and ask myself: “Which sector has the greatest potential for
            the future?” The answer I came up with was <em>technology</em>. So I grabbed every internet course I could find and
            started studying. In six months I landed my first developer job.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today I’ve been working as a developer for a year and a half. It has been an incredible journey. As a
            creativity driven person I thought I would never truly be interested about IT because to me it seemed so
            uncreative. I was wrong. IT can be as creative as we let it. The world of technology is a world of endless
            possibilities. In here the only limit is our own imagination.
